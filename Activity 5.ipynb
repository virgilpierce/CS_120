    "- (Kirkhoff's Current Law) The sum of the currents into a junction point is zero.\n",
    "- (Kirkhoff's Voltage Law) The sum of the voltages of a circuit is equal to zero.\n",
    "- (Ohm's Law) The voltage on a resistor is proportional to the current:  $ E_R = R I$\n",
    "- The voltage drop across a capacitor is proportional to the electrical charge q of the capacitor: $ E_C = \\frac{1}{C} q $\n",
    "\n",
    "- Considering the charge q of a capacitor, the rate at which the charge changes is the current throught the capacitor (capacitors store or release current as charge $q$):  $$ I = \\frac{dq}{dt} $$\n",

    "\n",
    "So if we have an RC circuit - a resisitor, a capacitor, and a voltage source in series, we can add up the voltages we get and we find:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ V_R + V_C = E = \\mbox{the source voltage} $$\n",

    "$$ R I + \\frac{1}{C} q = E $$ \n",

    "\n",
    "$$ R \\frac{dq}{dt} + \\frac{1}{C} q = E $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose our resisitor is $R = 1 \\mbox{Ohms}$ and the capacitor is $10^{-2} \\mbox{Faradays}$, if the applied voltage is a constant $V$ volts, what happens to the circuit for different values of $V$?\n",

    "Fix a value for $E = V$ and write a function that takes a value for charge $q$ and a time $t$, and returns the value of $\\frac{dq}{dt}$. Note that $t$ is not actually used in computing the return value, but it needs to be there for the *odeint* command to work correctly."
