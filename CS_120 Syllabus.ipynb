    "## Course Description\n",
    "\n",
    "From the catalogue: Become familiar with designing and writing programs in a high-level language. Programs will involve some technical applications in science and mathematics. \n",
    "\n",
    "Topics will include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Built-in variable types:  Integers, Floating Point Numbers, Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries.\n",
    "- Loops and Recursion\n",
    "- Functions\n",
    "- Conditions and Flow Control\n",
    "- Using common modules for math and science computations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Software\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the software (and the book) for class is available for free:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python\n",
    "\n",
    "The course uses Python as the primary programming langauge. Python is an excellent first language, and also a good environment for exploring algorithms before taking them to other languages for implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's advantages include:  \n",
    "- A syntax that encourages writing easy to read programs\n",
    "- human readable code:  almost always a statement does exactly what it says it does if you read it in English\n",
    "- dynamic typing: typing variables is handled automatically removing one of the major barriers in learning a first language\n",
    "- Interactive Dynamic Environment: Python can be run in an IDE meaning you can execute a statement and then see what it did\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is also now the most commonly used language in math and science for professional computations. UNC is in the process of phasing out the use of commercial software for mathematics computations to use Python instead. \n",
    "\n",
    "The disadvantages of Python are:\n",
    "- It is dynamically typed:  Your code will not give you a warning if you assume something is an integer and it is not.\n",
    "- It is not usually compiled:  Compiling is a process other languages use to process the human written code into instructions for the computer. Compiled languages are much much faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a variety of IDE softwares you could use which provide the primary interface we will use for interacting with Python. I am particularly fond of Jupyter for reasons we will discuss in class. You have the following options for accessing Jupyter:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You can install a local version of Jupyter on your personal computer. I recommend downloading Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual which is a package manager for Python / Jupyter. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. You can access something like Jupyter with Google Colab. This does require a google account; but you will not need to install anything, and it will work on Chromebooks, tablets, and phones.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Jupyter is also isntalled on the university Apporto Server which you can access here: https://unco.apporto.com/  You will not need to install anything, and it will work on Chromebooks, tablets, and phones.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. If you are interested, we have a set of computers the university is letting us install Linux on, and once we get them configured for Linux we will be able to have Jupyter/Python running there.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visualizing Your Code\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the online tool: Python Tutor for visualizing our code and understanding what the computer is doing. You can find this tool via this link: https://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit\n",
    "\n",
    "I apologize for the advertisements that appear here, but otherwise this is a very useful tool that will show you what the instructions you have given the computer are doing step by step.\n"

    "\n",
    "You can purchase a print copy if you prefer that. \n",

    "### Course Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "The notes we use in course, include some code examples are provided on Github: https://github.com/virgilpierce/CS_120\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are in the Applied Math or Software Engineering majors it would be worth your time to start learning how to use Github, though for our course I am not going to require that you use it. I find it is a useful tool for recording the history of my courses and also for distributing my course materials to those interested in using it.\n",
    "\n",
    "It also syncs easily with Google Colab if you are using that.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other References\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a lot of resources for Python available. If you would like more detail, I recommend the O'Reily series of books. However I also find that books rarely answer all of my questions - learning how to google for information about how to do things or what is not working is an important skill to develop as a scientist and a programmer specifically.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will talk in class about troubleshooting (or debugging your code). Do not submit code that is giving an error when it runs - bring it to me and we can figure out what is going wrong.\n",

    "## Learning Objectives / Outcomes for the Course\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result of this course, students will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. use computer programming to solve computational problems in mathematics and science;\n",
    "2. develop algorithms and then implement them\n",
    "3. evaluate code written by someone else and explain what the result should be, or what correction is needed.\n",
    "4. write functions, loops, and control structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical week of class will involve posing a question for which Python is a good solution, exploring some of the tools we need in order to solve it, and then learning how to use those tools as implemented for Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "A caveate about the course and this topic:  I have learned 8 computer languages fluently (and 0 human languages - I know just enough Spanish to get into a lot of trouble in Mexico). Each one you learn will be easier than the ones before with some exceptions. I have never learned them from a course - the best way to learn the language is to find a problem you want to solve and then write a program to solve it. Do enough of this and you will know the language.\n",
    "\n",
    "**So why this course?**  I am going to pose to you a series of problems that will help us formulate structure we need from Python to solve it; we will then learn about that structure, and then solve the problem. In the process we will be learning Python, but more generally we will be learning about how algorithms a computer can use are structured and how to build an algorithm for a problem. However we will do three project as part of the course that will give you some choice in what to spend your time learning how to program, I encourage you to take the opportunity to use programming for something related to your major or one of your hobbies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Future courses in CS at UNC you can take will cover more powerful tools, particularly ones that exploit the way computers work, and the analysis of algorithms to determine which ones are best and estimate how much power is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a fascinating subject. If you are interested in languages beyond Python and Java that we teach, I would like to be forming a club for students that are learning newer languages that are less used."

If in doubt, please do ask, and always provide attribution if you are using what someone else has done. Interestingly, we will be using a few of the standard modules for Python which are by definition code others have written, but we will be explicit in what we are doing. "
