    "For example the French Army uses a unit called **gradian** for which a right angle measures 100 Gradians (abbreviated gons). \n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe not surprisingly, the trigonometric functions in *numpy* use **radians** as their unit of angle (for which a right angle measures $\\pi/2$ radians (abbreviated rad). Radians are intuitive because they give the arc length of the unit circle swept out by the corresponding angle. However Gradians are nice because, ..., well no $\\pi$!!\n",

    "We can convert a gradian mesurment: $x$ into a radian measurment by computing the ratio $x \\frac{\\pi}{200} $ (why?).\n",
