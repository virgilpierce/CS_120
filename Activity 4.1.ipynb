    "# Activity 4.1:  Euclidean Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The Euclidean Algorithm is a method for computing the greatest common divisor of two numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we are given 1345 and 75 and asked to find the greatest common divisor of them:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We compute the relationship: 1345 == 17 * 75 + 70\n",
    "2. We then replace 1345 with 75 and 75 with 70 to compute: 75 = 1 * 70 + 5\n",
    "3. Finally we replace 75 with 70 and 70 with 5 to compute: 70 = 14 * 5 + 0\n",
    "\n",
    "This works because the gcd(1345, 75) = gcd(75, 70) = gcd(70, 5) = gcd(5, 0) = 5\n",
    "\n",
    "What we want to do today is write a function that implements the Euclidean Algorithm and produces the gcd of two numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there is a gcd function already written in *numpy* but let's not use that, and there is probably one written in other modules. The point is to write our own."
