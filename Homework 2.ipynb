    "**Reading:** Read chapters 2 and 3 in the textbook. Remember it is online. Where it is discussing the *math* pakcage you can use the *numpy* package instead as you are following along.\n",

    "## Question 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that the cover price of a book is 24.95 dollars, however bookstores get a 40% discount. Shipping costs 3 dollars for the first copy and 75 cents for each additional copy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function *wholesale(n)* that returns the total wholesale cost for an order of n books.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 2: \n",
    "\n",
    "What type is the input *n*, what type is the output *wholesale(n)*?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quesiton 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "If you were to pass your function a float as an input, what happens? Does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 4:\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a second wholesale function for a different book that costs 22.95 dollars, has the same discount, but that ships for 3 dollars for the first copy and 85 cents for each additional copy. Call this function wholesale2.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 5:\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are actually objects themselves, and they have a type. As a result you can pass functions to other functions. Write a function *total_cost(wholesale, wholesale2, n)* and returns a Boolean value True if wholesale(n) > wholesale2(n); and False if wholesale(n) $\\leq$ wholesale2(n).\n",
