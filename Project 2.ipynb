    "For project 2, lets grapple with a common use of dictionaries in Python compute frequencies:\n",

    "You can find a copy of Mary Shelley's Frankenstine on Project Guttenberg: https://www.gutenberg.org/files/84/84-0.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to compute the following items from this text:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Find the five most common words that had more than 3 letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an outline of how I would approach it, but if you see another way by all means do that, your result should be answers to the bullet above:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First inspect the book by just openning the link in your browser and notice that Project Guttenberg has added some items to the beginning and the end, you will need to determine how to get Python to not include this material, not written by Mary Shelley in your analysis. You can execute a .readline() 300 times to skip the first 300 characters for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. You can open the book use the urlopen package we used earlier in class and read it line by line. (you could also save the book to your computer and open it directly).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The str.split() method is a useful way to break up a line of text into words.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. You might want to deal with punctuation, i.e. some words are going to end in punctuation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. After that write code that will count the frequency of each word used: I suggest using a dictionary (that starts as an empty diction count = dict() ) as we will show in class for letters, to count the frequency of words.  If the word is in the dictionary key already increment its counter by 1; otherwise if the word is not in the dictionary key add it with a counter value of 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. You will then need a function that takes your dictionary with the counts and sorts it to find the five most frequently used words. See the examples from class of functions we wrote for manipulating a dictionary.\n",
    "\n"
