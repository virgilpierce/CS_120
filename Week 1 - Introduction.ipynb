    "# Introduction to Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "An intro to the intro:  This class is going to be about my favorite mathematics subject - programming. Programming for me is the reason I got interested in mathematics and science. This question:\n",
    "\n",
    "*How would I have a computer find an example of this, compute this, prove this?* \n",
    "\n",
    "has guided me through more than 10 years of learning mathematics, physics, and chemistry.\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python and Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "This course will introduce you to programming with the language Python. Python is a fantastic first programming language to learn. It has also become the default language for scientific computations at least in the cases where low power is needed. Before I explain why it is such a great language, let me also introduce you to Jupyter -- Jupyter is the software I recommend you use to interact with Python. You have a couple of options for accessing it:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If you have your own laptop here with you in class today, or if you are using a Chromebook or Tablet, and you have a Google Account:  go to https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb?utm_source=scs-index#recent=true\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If you have your own laptop here with you in class today, or if you are using a Chromebook or Tablet, and you do not have a Google Account:  go to https://unco.apporto.com/\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Finally you can log in to the machine in front of you and start Jupyter by searching for it in the start menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Additionally you can also install Jupyter and Python on your own computer, there are isntructions in Canvas, but do not do it today as it takes time.\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "Now for why Python is such a nice first language, and follow along by executing the commands yourself.  A couple of notes: to a great extent you cannot hurt your computer and while Python may complain and flash red messages, there is really very little that can go wrong. So try things. Computer languages have to be used and explored to see how they work. Don't ask what will happen, change it and see. *Eff Around and Find Out* is literally more than half of programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "(we will talk later in the course about some ways that Python code could hurt your computer, but it is impossible with the things we will be doing in class).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dynamic Typing: Python will guess what type of object you are using.\n"

    "Why is dynamic typing unique?  Well many other languages require you to declare what type of object a variable will be before you can use it.
